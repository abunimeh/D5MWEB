TIMING-2#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock zynq_soc_i/CLK_GEN_148MHZ/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate pin zynq_soc_i/CLK_GEN_148MHZ/inst/clk_in1. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock zynq_soc_i/CLK_GEN_148MHZ/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_1 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hierarchical -filter {NAME =~ */COUPLER_INST/FIFO_INST/FIFO_INST/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/*rstblk*/*PRE*}]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '23' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency).
